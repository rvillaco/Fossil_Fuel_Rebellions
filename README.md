This repository includes the source code necessary for the results presented in the paper "Are fossil fuel reforms causing rebellions? Lessons for political stability".

This work examines how different types of fuel price reforms affect protest dynamics in Ecuador, a country with varied experiences in subsidy adjustments. Leveraging a novel methodological approach that combines administrative police data and protest indicators from ACLED and GDELT via neural networks and ARIMAX models, we construct a comprehensive daily protest-intensity series from 2018 to 2024. Using a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, we test whether changes in diesel, regular gasoline, and premium gasoline prices Granger-cause shifts in protest activity. Our findings demonstrate that diesel price increases trigger substantial and persistent protests, whereas regular gasoline reforms generate moderate, short-lived responses, and premium gasoline reforms have no significant impact.
